# qt-2048
The game 2048 implemented in C++ using Qt-creator. The game logic was given ready by the schools course staff. I created the GUI using Qt-creator. Instructions for the game can be found in Finnish and English in the repo. To play the game clone in to the repo, and run the project on your own Qt-creator. Let me know if you find any bugs of sorts. Cheers
